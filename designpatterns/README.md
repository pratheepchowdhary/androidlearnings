# Design Patterns Library

Welcome to the **Design Patterns Library**! This repository is a centralized collection of well-documented design patterns to help developers build robust, reusable, and scalable software solutions. It covers a wide range of design patterns commonly used in software development.

---

## üìò What Are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They are templates designed to help developers make architecture choices that are efficient and maintainable. These patterns are broadly categorized into:

- **Creational Patterns**: Focused on object creation mechanisms.
- **Structural Patterns**: Concerned with object composition.
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Address interactions between objects.

## üìÇ Repository Structure
This repository is structured to help you quickly find and understand any design pattern. Each folder contains:
- A brief **description** of the pattern.
- Use cases and examples in **Java** and **Kotlin**.
- A folder for **diagrams** (UMLs, flowcharts).
- Optionally, implementations in Android contexts.

### **1. Creational Patterns**

- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype
- Object Pool

### **2. Structural Patterns**
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator

- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor
