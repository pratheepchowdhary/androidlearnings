1. Theming in Android

What is Theming?

A theme in Android is a collection of global attributes applied to the entire application, setting the visual identity for your app. Themes affect elements like colors, typography, and shapes across all UI components.

Creating a Theme

Themes are typically defined in the res/values/themes.xml file. You can either use a base theme provided by Android (e.g., Theme.Material3.DayNight) or customize one for your app.

Example:

<style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.Material3.DayNight">
    <item name="colorPrimary">#6200EE</item>
    <item name="colorSecondary">#03DAC5</item>
    <item name="android:windowBackground">#FFFFFF</item>
</style>

Apply the theme in the AndroidManifest.xml file:

<application
    android:theme="@style/AppTheme">
</application>

DayNight Themes (Light/Dark Modes)

To support light and dark themes, Android provides DayNight themes. You can define specific colors for each mode in themes.xml and themes-night.xml:

Example:

<!-- res/values/themes.xml -->
<item name="colorPrimary">#FFFFFF</item>

<!-- res/values-night/themes.xml -->
<item name="colorPrimary">#000000</item>

Enable automatic theme switching with system settings by using Theme.Material3.DayNight.

2. Styling in Android

What is Styling?

Styles are reusable collections of attributes that define the appearance of specific UI components (e.g., buttons, text). They help maintain consistency and reduce duplication.

Difference Between Themes and Styles

Themes: Apply globally to the app or activity.

Styles: Apply to individual components (e.g., TextView, Button).


Using Styles in XML

Define styles in res/values/styles.xml and apply them to components.

Example:

<style name="CustomButtonStyle" parent="Widget.Material3.Button">
    <item name="android:backgroundTint">#6200EE</item>
    <item name="android:textColor">#FFFFFF</item>
</style>

Apply the style:

<Button
    style="@style/CustomButtonStyle"
    android:text="Click Me" />

3. Material Design Guidelines

Introduction to Material Design

Material Design is a design system developed by Google to ensure consistent, intuitive, and responsive user interfaces. It focuses on clarity, usability, and visual hierarchy.

Core Principles

1. Motion: Seamless transitions and animations.


2. Shape: Rounded corners, minimalistic design.


3. Color: Harmonious, accessible color palettes.


4. Typography: Clear, consistent text styles.



Material Components and Theming

Material Design provides ready-made UI components like buttons, cards, and dialogs through Material Components for Android.

Example - Using MaterialButton:

<com.google.android.material.button.MaterialButton
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:text="Material Button"
    style="@style/Widget.Material3.Button" />

Customize Material Design theming:

<style name="Theme.MyApp" parent="Theme.Material3.DayNight">
    <item name="colorPrimary">#FF5722</item>
    <item name="shapeAppearanceCornerSmall">8dp</item>
</style>

4. Best Practices

1. Follow Material Guidelines: Adhere to Material Design principles for consistency.


2. Support Dark Mode: Use DayNight themes for better user accessibility.


3. Reusability: Define common styles and themes for consistency and maintainability.


4. Leverage Material Components: Use Material3 base components for modern UI/UX.


5. Typography and Color Accessibility: Ensure text and colors are accessible (WCAG-compliant).
