# Architecture Patterns Library

Welcome to the **Architecture Patterns Library**! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for software developers to explore, learn, and implement architectural patterns that promote scalable, maintainable, and testable software solutions.

---

## üìò What Are Architecture Patterns?
Architecture patterns are high-level strategies used to organize and structure software systems. They define the relationships between components and guide developers in decision-making for better code organization and application development.

### Why Use Architecture Patterns?
- Promote code **reusability** and **maintainability**.
- Facilitate **scalability** and better **testability**.
- Enhance **separation of concerns**.
- Provide a **standard structure** for teams and projects.

## üìÇ Repository Structure
This repository is categorized into various architecture patterns. Each folder includes:
- A **conceptual explanation** of the pattern.
- **Use cases** and benefits.
- **Code examples** in Java and Kotlin.
- Diagrams (UML, flowcharts, etc.).
- Contextual examples with Android.

### **1. Common Architecture Patterns**
- Layered Architecture (n-tier)
- Client-Server Architecture
- Microservices Architecture
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

### **2. UI and Application Architecture Patterns**
- MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- MVP (Model-View-Presenter)
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- MVI (Model-View-Intent)
- Redux

### **3. Advanced Architecture Patterns**
- Clean Architecture
- Hexagonal Architecture
- Modular Architecture
- Onion Architecture
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

### **4. Android-Specific Architecture Patterns**
- Jetpack Architecture Components
    - ViewModel
    - LiveData
    - Navigation
    - Room Database
- Best practices with Dependency Injection (Dagger, Hilt, Koin)
